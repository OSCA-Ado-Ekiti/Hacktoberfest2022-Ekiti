1. Fork the repository: forking a repository creates a copy of the repository on your accoount. This allows you to freely experiment changes without affecting the main repository.

After clicking the fork button in the image above, you'll complete the forking process by clicking the create fork button

2. Create a branch of yours to make your contributions: creating a branch allows you to separate your changes from the main branch which can later be added to the main branch if there is no error or conflict. Else, discarded.

![branch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53593233/195101930-5bcc6a38-9fa6-477c-a702-86147296aeac.PNG)

Input the name of your branch and then click "Create branch: branch-name" slightly below the branch name input area


3. When you are done creating the branch, you can start making your contributions.
